# Old Config

## Please do not use this

This config is legacy

These are the configuration files that I already have been using.

It is a bit of a mess because it mixes lua inside of a vimscript and is hard to mantain.

I also want to be able to load colorschemes.

This will get the lease amont of documentation.
