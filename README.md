# nvim-config
This repository holds my neovim config files. It will get iterated upon. This way, as I deal with different systems. Feel free to take this if you want. It is the bare-bones basic config.  It is likely good for new users, as it does not have much that is lazy, and will have documentation about some of the "obvious" things.
